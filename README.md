## Description 
[Walk through demo](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/B6tC5HSeR6gNz0tii2kx)

This application generates a professional README by taking users input by utilizing inquirer.  The users inputs are rendered into a README markdown file following good README practices.

## Installation

npm i 

## Code Highlight

Even though this same action could have been executed with a simple if statement, this was my first time working with switch cases and I wanted to try it out.  There is a case for each option that the user has and a coresponding badge points to a url for that badge. Depending on the users choise a different badge url will be passed into the markdown.  
```Js
switch (license) {
    case "Apache 2.0 License":
      badge = apache;
      break;
    case "GNU":
      badge = GNU
      break;
    case "MIT License":
      badge = MIT
      break;
    case "BSD2 License":
      badge = BSD2
      break;
    default:
      return ""

  }
  return `![License badge](${badge})`

```

## Learning Points 
This was my first interaction with Node.js as well as the packages that can be used with it.  It was my first time not having a HTML and CSS doc, and not opening my code in the browser and instead in the Node.js environment.

* Node.js
* inquirer
* fs 
* switch cases 
* ternary operators
* module exports
* functions within template literals

## Usage 

To generate a customizable professional README
